Let’s wear the sun on your skin
Like a favorite dress
Show me your smile
Let’s get out of the city
To dance in the sand
You and I
I've had a crush on
You since way back when
I want you to
Tell me what is on your mind
You know my feeling?
I ’m crazy over you… oh baby
Palm trees and ocean breeze
I feel you close to me
I ’m crazy over you... oh baby
Staring at the sunset babe
Keep on dancing with me
Hold me tight
Palm trees and sun-kissed hair
You take my breath away
I ’m crazy over you...oh baby
Staring at the sunset babe
Keep on dancing with me
Hold me tight
＜Interlude＞
Let’s get out of here
I wanna be alone with you
Tell me yourself
Let me stand by your side
I don’t need something special
I just want you
I've had a crush on
You since way back when
I want you to
Tell me what is on your mind
You know my feeling?
I ’m crazy over you… oh baby
Palm trees and ocean breeze
I feel you close to me
I ’m crazy over you... oh baby
Staring at the sunset babe
Keep on dancing with me
Hold me tight
Palm trees and sun-kissed hair
You take my breath away
I ’m crazy over you...oh baby
Staring at the sunset babe
Keep on dancing with me
Hold me tight
＜Interlude＞
I will remember
The ways that you kissed me
Feeling the sounds of the breeze
I will remember
Every piece of you
Hearing the sounds of the waves
I will remember
The ways that you kissed me
Feeling the sounds of the breeze
I will remember
Every piece of you
Hearing the sounds of the waves
I will remember
The ways that you kissed me
Feeling the sounds of the breeze
I will remember
Every piece of you
Hearing the sounds of the waves
