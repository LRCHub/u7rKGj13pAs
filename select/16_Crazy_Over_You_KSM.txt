I try keeping my composure
No use when I see you
One look just took me over
What's a girl supposed to do
You got me, you caught me
I'm not complaining
Lock me up, throw away
The key
You did it, I'm in it
There's no escaping
Got it so bad, can't you see that
You have made a mess outta me
Look how you knocked me off of my feet
I'm right where I wanna be
Messed up like crazy over you
Just for your information
No one's ever done what you do
Can't stop infatuation
Well I have to admit it's true
You got me, you caught me
I'm not complaining
Lock me up, throw away the key
You did it, I'm in it
There's no escaping
Got it so bad, can't you see that
You have made a mess outta me
Look how you knocked me off of my feet
I'm right where I wanna be
Messed up like crazy over you
You have made a mess outta me
Look how you got me losin' my sleep
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Messed up like crazy over you
You, you, you... nothing I can do
Look what you put me through
You turn my whole world upside down
Like crazy
You have made a mess outta me
Look how you knocked me off my feet
I'm right where I wanna be
Messed up like crazy over you
You have made a mess outta me
Look how you got me losin' my sleep
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Messed up like crazy over you
