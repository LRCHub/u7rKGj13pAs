Can't you tell by the spell that I'm under
This fella's wonderin' if you'll let me get next to you
Is there a chance of gettin' through
You never seem to notice me no matter what I do
And everybody in town knows I'm crazy over you

It's for sure there's no cure for your kissin'
Doctor says this is the last thing I'll ever do
My heart will break right in two
You never seem to notice me no matter what I do
And everybody in town knows I'm crazy over you

Everybody knows that I've been after you girl
Come on sweet baby let's give it a whirl
Give it up darlin' I'll make you all mine
And we can be together lovin' all the time
[ Guitar ]
Can't you tell by the spell...
Well you turn your pretty head away I'm actin' like a fool
And everybody in town knows I'm crazy over you
[ Guitar ]
Everybody in town knows I'm crazy over you
