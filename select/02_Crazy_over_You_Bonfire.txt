I've been livin' in a dream
Where there's not a sound
But tears that I have cried over you
I've been beaten down
And kicked around
Not what I expected from you
All those times you said
We'd last forever
Not one truth was ever told
It's a long way
That we have come
I've given my heart
To a love that's done
Tears me up inside
When I know I'm better
How can I just turn away
When I'm so crazy over you

Only time will tell
If it's heaven or hell
The fire burning inside of me
I never did you wrong
But still you're gone
How did I not ever see
All those many promises surrendered
Never saw the light of day
It's a long way
That we have come
I've given my heart
To a love that's done
Tears me up inside
When I know I'm better
How can I just turn away
When I'm so crazy over you

An angel's smile or the devil's fate
Caught in a war between love and hate
Tears me up inside
Cause I know I'm better
It's a long way
That we have come
I've given my heart
To a love that's done
Tears me up inside
When I know I'm better
How can I just turn away
When I'm so crazy over you
